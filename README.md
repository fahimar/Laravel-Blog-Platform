## About

This project demonstrates the use of Laravel to build a robust RESTful API for managing blog posts and their associated comments. The primary goal is to provide a secure and efficient system that handles user registration, authentication, post creation, updates, deletion, and comment management.

Key features of the API include:

-   **User Authentication**: Registration and login with JWT tokens powered by Laravel Sanctum.
-   **CRUD Operations for Posts**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete blog posts.
-   **CRUD Operations for Comments**: Add, retrieve, and delete comments associated with blog posts.
-   **File Uploads**: Upload images associated with blog posts.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install Required Software

Before getting started, ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

-   PHP >= 8.0
-   Composer
-   Git
-   MySQL (or any other supported database)

### Step 2: Clone the GitHub Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

### Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd <repository-directory>
```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

Install all the dependencies required for the project:

```bash
composer install
```

### Step 5: Create a Copy of the Environment File

Duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Step 6: Configure the Environment File

Open the `.env` file in a text editor and configure your database settings and other necessary environment variables.

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=blog
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password

# Configure mail, cache, etc. as necessary
```

### Step 7: Generate Application Key

Generate the application key used by Laravel to encrypt sensitive data:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### Step 8: Run Migrations

Run the database migrations to create the necessary tables for posts, comments, and users:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### Step 9: Serve the Application

Start the Laravel development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Your application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
